# Sentiment-Analysis
This is a python webapp which calculates the sentiment scores of comments and plots the scatter plot based on the scores of the sentiment.

In order to use flask, we need to install it by typing the following:

pip install flask

Once you're done with installing Flask, create a folder called FlaskApp. 
Navigate to the FlaskApp folder and create a file called app.py. 
Import the flask module and create an app using Flask.

In order to execute the app through command prompt, save the changes and execute app.py:
python app.py
